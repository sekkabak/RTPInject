The following are directions for use of RTPInject:

1) First, launch RTPInject by performing the following command as root:
bash# python rtpinject.py

2) When RTPInject loads it will show three fields in the main screen, the "Source" field, the 
"Destination" field, and the "Voice Codec" field. The Source field will be autopopulated as 
RTPInject sniffs RTP streams on the wire. When a new IP address appears in the Source field, 
the user can click on it and the Destination and Voice Codec fields will then be autopopulated 
with the destination host of the stream and the voice codec in use in the stream. 

3) Ths user now pushes the button with the folder icon which allows the user to navigate the 
filesystem and select an appropriate file. RTPInject is able to perform automatic transcoding
from a variety of audio formats, depending on the gstreamer plugins installed, to the PCM-U, PCM-A, 
or GSM formats suitable for injection. If the communication occurs using one of the less common 
codecs, the user is still able to inject audio, however they will have to pre-create a file in the
appropriate format. Now that the user knows the voice codec in use, they can create the file they 
wish to inject with an audio tool such as Sound Recorder for Windows or Sox for Linux. These tools 
provide the means to transcode audio to most of the often used RTP codecs such as PCMA, PCMU, and 
GSM. Once this file is created using one of these tools, the user pushes the button with the folder 
icon which allows the user to navigate the file system and select the appropriate sound file.

4) With the RTP stream and audio file selected, the users pushes the Inject button. This will 
inject the selected sound file to the destination host in the RTP stream.
